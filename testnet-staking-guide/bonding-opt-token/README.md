# Bonding OPT token

When staking make sure you leave a small amount of OPT tokens transferable in both accounts. Do not bond your total amount from your stash also.

In this process we will create a new validator/nominator stash and bond it to participate in staking. Do not send funds directly via a transfer to a validator.

At first, go to the _Network&gt;Account actions_ section, like the arrow indicates.

As you can see, You can set up two accounts here, which You added earlier, i.e. the stash account and the controller account. This is a recommended option.

When we set up the stash and the controller accounts please enter in the window below how many OPT tokens You want to stake. Remember to leave a small amount of token for fees.

In the next window, we set the account to be funded with staking rewards and here we have several options.

You can fund:

1. stash account and add the rewards to stake automatically \(recommended because You will get compound interests,
2. stash account but donâ€™t add the rewards to stake automatically,
3. controller account,
4. any other account.

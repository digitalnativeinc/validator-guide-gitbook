# Installing Polkadot JS wallet extension

Polkadot.js is a browser extension that does one thing: it manages accounts and allows the signing of transactions with those accounts. It does not inject providers for use by dapps at this early point, nor does it perform wallet functions, e.g send funds. This extension is open source and the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension).

You can get more info in the [developer documentation](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/extension/).

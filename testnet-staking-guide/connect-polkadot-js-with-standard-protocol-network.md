# Connecting Polkadot JS with Standard Protocol Network

It is time to connect polkadot.js extension with Opportunity Testnet app \(called a wallet\). To do so please use the following link: [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.opportunity.standard.tech\#/explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.opportunity.standard.tech#/explorer)

Polkadot.js extension window will pop up and ask You to confirm that You want to connect the extension with this app. It is always good to check whether the address of the app is correct. If everything is ok just click the button indicated by the arrow \(_Yes, allow this application access_\).

In that case go to Settings&gt;Metadata and click Update metadata on the right of Your screen and confirm it with polkakdot.js extension\).
